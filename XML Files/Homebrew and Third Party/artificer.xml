Schematics that target constructs use their body for this component.</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Cantrips: </text>			<text>	You know the Mending, Light, and Prestidigitation cantrips. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Schematics Binder: </text>			<text>	You have a schematics binder, which contains magical blueprints related to linking magic to objects. At first level it contains detect magic, identify, and three 1st level spells from any class. You can activate or create magic items as if you were a spellcaster whose spell list includes the contents of your schematics binder. Schematic types are Potion Schematic, Spell Schematic, and Item Schematic.</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Ritual Caster: </text>			<text>	If a spell schematic in your binder has the Ritual tag, you can cast it as a ritual without using a spell slot. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spellcrafting Ability: </text>			<text>	Intelligence is your ability for artificer infusions and spellcrafting, as you have to reverse-engineer and hack together an improvised version of a spell (spell schematic) instead of casting it. Whenever you create a magical effect from a schematic or cast an infusion, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and spell attack roll: </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Saving Throw DC = 8+Your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spell Attack Modifier = Your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Acquiring schematics of 1st level and higher: </text>			<text>	Every time you gain an artificer level, you choose one new spell of at least 1st level from any class's list and add it as a schematic in your schematics binder. You can also add a spell you find to your binder, similar to the Spellbook sidebar (PHB page 114) but they are added as schematics instead. Schematics employ a different formulation than spells in spellbooks or ritual books, so a spellbook cannot supply a schematic and vice versa; however, other schematics, spell scrolls, and certain other magical writings can supply the appropriate information. You cannot learn a spell schematic of any level higher than the level specified in the Artificer table.</text>			<text>	You can learn 2nd level spell schematics at 5th level, 3rd at 8th, 4th at 11th, 5th at 14th, 6th at 17th, and 7th at 20th.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Craft Reserve</name>			<text>When another class feature of yours creates a temporary magical object, its magic is sustained by your craft reserve. Your craft reserve is equal to your artificer level plus your Intelligence modifier. Spent craft reserve recovers after the item it was spent to create is no longer magical and you finish a long rest, unless otherwise mentioned.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Concoct Potions</name>			<text>As part of a short rest, if you have a vial of water and a component pouch available, spend one or more points of craft reserve to create one magic potion (see below). The type of potions you can create are limited by your artificer level and whether or not it is listed as a potion schematic in your schematics binder. Potions last until consumed or destroyed.</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Level &#8212; Reserve &#8212; Potion Rarity:</text>			<text>1st &#8212; 1 &#8212; Common</text>			<text>3rd &#8212; 2 &#8212; Uncommon</text>			<text>6th &#8212; 3 &#8212; Rare</text>			<text>11th &#8212; 2 &#8212; Very Rare</text>			<text>17th &#8212; 5 &#8212; Legendary</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Write Scroll</name>			<text>As part of a short rest, if you have a quill, ink, and a sheet of parchment paper available, you can create one spell scroll of any spell schematic recorded in your schematics binder. Doing so costs you 1 point of craft reserve per level of the spell, and you must supply any components the spell requires. These scrolls remain until used or destroyed and are not restricted by Object Dependence when activating.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Exquisite Crafter</name>			<text>Choose 1 common magic item and learn its schematic (Potion, Scroll, or Item schematic). You learn this schematic and can use it to craft the specified item in your downtime. For every artificer level gained after 1st, you can gain an additional schematic equal or lower to the rarity specified in the Artificer table. </text>			<text>	In addition, all magic items of the rarity specified in the Artificer table that you can create have their base cost to craft cut in half, effectively halving both cost and time to craft.</text>			<text>	Starting at 3rd level, you can learn schematics for and craft uncommon items; at 6th, rare items; at 11th, very rare items; and at 17th, legendary items.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>
	<autolevel level="2">		<slots>3</slots>		<feature>			<name>Infusions</name>			<text>You specialize in the practice of creating matter or imbuing objects with magic. Starting at 2nd level, you gain two Infusions of your choice. Your infusions are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain artificer levels, you gain additional infusions of your choice, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.</text>			<text>	You learn an additional infusion at 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th level. </text>			<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the infusions you know and replace it with another infusion you could learn at that level.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Personal Weapon Augmentation</name>			<text>While fighting with a weapon under the influence of your Augmentation infusion, you may use your Intelligence modifier on attack and damage rolls. The weapon also deals bonus damage of the chosen type at 5th (+1d4), 11th (+2d4), and 17th (+3d4) level.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Augmentation</name>			<text>As an action, you can infuse a weapon or piece of armor (clothes and shields included) with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. If you chose a weapon, it is now a magic weapon which deals damage of that type in place of one of its normal damage types. If you chose a piece of armor, it now gives resistance to that damage type. Only one effect can be used per item at a time and these effects last for 1 hour. You can use this ability number of times equal to your intelligence modifier per long rest.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Disable Construct</name>			<text>As an action, you can infuse damaging energy into a construct. The construct must be within 30 ft of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target loses 1d8 hit points on a failed save and half damage on a successful one. This amount increases as you level, 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 8th level, 4d8 at 11th level, 5d8 at 14th level, 6d8 at 17th level and 7d8 at 20th level. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier per long rest.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Extended Infusion</name>			<text>You can double the duration of an effect from an infusion, scroll, potion, or magic item if it has a duration of 1 minute or longer, to a maximum of 24 hours.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Lubricant</name>			<text>You can cast grease at will without expending material components.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Pending Potion</name>			<text>You can administer the effect of a potion you&#8217;ve ingested within the last 24 hours as a bonus action instead of at the time of ingestion. Only one potion can be used in this way at a time.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Reboot</name>			<text>As an action, you can touch a dying construct that has 0 hit points. The construct becomes stable and regains one hit point.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Infusion: Repair Damage</name>			<text>As an action, you can touch a construct to infuse repairing energy into it. The target regains 1d8 hit points. This amount increases as you level, 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 8th level, 4d8 at 11th level, 5d8 at 14th level, 6d8 at 17th level and 7d8 at 20th level.

	<autolevel level="3">		<slots>3</slots>		<feature>			<name>Artificer Specialization</name>			<text>At 3rd level, you become affiliated with your preferred method of artifice: Battle Engineer, Arcanotechnician or Master Maker. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Battle Engineer</name>			<text>Battle Engineers are the epitome of field testers. They charge into the fray with a freshly crafted Flaming Sword to scorch their enemies. &#8220;Who better to use these creations than the creator?&#8221; These Artificers prefer martial prowess compared to other artificers.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bonus Proficiencies (Battle Engineer)</name>			<text>When you specialize into Battle Engineer at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Physical Augmentation (Battle Engineer)</name>			<text>Also at 3rd level, you learn the Augmentation infusion which does not count against your total number of infusions known. If you already knew this infusion, you learn a different infusion of your choice. In addition, when you use this infusion on a piece of armor or a shield, you can instead choose piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage as the resisted type.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Arcanotechnician</name>			<text>Arcanotechnicians always have the right tool for the situation. They hastily create devices for the task at hand, but the quality suffers because of it. These tools have a tendency to backfire or cause other devastating mishaps. The extra versatility comes with the risk of volatility.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Inventor (Arcanotechnician)</name>			<text>At 3rd level, you can spend one minute creating a Spell Storing Item. Doing so infuses a small object with one spell schematic you know of your choice (you must provide the material components of the chosen schematic while creating the item). At any point within an hour after creation, you can use the item to cast the schematic&#8217;s spell; the item takes the place of any components (including verbal and somatic components), but loses its magic after afterwards. Using the item takes your action, or the chosen spell&#8217;s casting time, whichever is longer. </text>			<text>	Using the item carries a risk of failure. When you use the item, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10+twice the schematic&#8217;s level) to cast the spell. If you fail the check, a mishap occurs instead; by default, this deals 1d6 force damage per level of the schematic to you, but alternative mishaps are possible (see Dungeon Master's Guide p.140 for a partial list of ideas). </text>			<text>	You can only have one Spell Storing Item at any given time.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Master Maker</name>			<text>Master Makers can create a mechanical helper that aids them inside and out of combat. Given time, they can make adjustments to their homunculus to adapt to the situation. These crafted constructs are a mental extension to the artificer and provides support as needed, similar to a familiar or animal companion.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Mechanic (Master Maker)</name>			<text>At 3rd level, you learn the Repair Damage infusion which does not count against your total number of infusions known. If you already knew this infusion, you learn a different infusion of your choice.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Craft Homunculus (Master Maker)</name>			<text>At 3rd level, over one week of downtime, you can create a homunculus to aid you in adventuring. Add your proficiency bonus to its AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill proficiencies. Its hit point maximum equals your artificer level times four. Commanding the homunculus telepathically is a bonus action. If uncommanded during combat, the DM controls it that round; it's loyal but not necessarily brave. Once commanded, it can deliver artificer touch spells for you as if it were a familiar (see the Find Familiar spell). If it is within 100 feet and is holding an arcane device or prototype you created, you can activate the item on the homunculus' behalf as an action (in addition to the bonus action needed to command the homunculus); the homunculus must use its reaction to make any attacks the spell requires. When you spend Hit Dice to recover HP, you can redirect any HP you would recover to the homunculus instead; at the end of any short rest where this happens, it also regains HP equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your homunculus is destroyed, you can construct a replacement with a week of downtime.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>
