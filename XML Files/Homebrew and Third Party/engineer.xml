Other gadgets have an effect that requires you to take an action in order to activate it. The type of action required to activate the effect will be listed in the description of the gadget. </text>			<text>	Object Interactions: Most gadgets are easy to activate, requiring you only to flip a switch or twist a dial. A gadget with an effect of this type can be activated at the same time you either move or take another action (such as an attack action). Some gadgets which can be used as weapons may require you take both an object interaction and an attack action at the same time. You can activate a second gadget effect that requires an object interaction on your turn by taking the Use an Object action. (See PHB pages 190 and 193 for more information about what sorts of actions can be combined with other actions.) </text>			<text>	Actions: A gadget effect with an activation time of 1 action requires that you focus your attention on the device in order to use it. </text>			<text>	Reactions: Some gadget effects can be activated as reactions. These effects are activated in response to some event. If a gadget can be activated as a reaction, the schematic description will tell you exactly when you can use it.</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Stacking Gadget Activations: </text>			<text>	You cannot activate two gadget effects that both require 1 action during the same turn. You can activate both a gadget that requires 1 action and another gadget that requires only an object interaction by combining both activations into one action or by using the bonus action granted by your Fast Activation feature. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Gadget Attack Rolls and Saving Throws: </text>			<text>	Some gadgets can be used as weapons, allowing you to make an attack roll. The ability score bonus added to this attack roll is listed in the text for the schematic for that particular gadget. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Gadget attack modifier = your proficiency bonus+the ability score modifier listed in the gadget description </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>	Your Intelligence modifier sets the DC for saving throws against effects created by the use of your gadgets. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Gadget save DC = 8+your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Nonmagical Nature: </text>			<text>	Although some gadgets create effects which are similar to those created by certain spells and magic items, gadgets and their effects are inherently non-magical. A gadget, or the effect created by a gadget, cannot be detected or dispelled using abilities that work on magic. Spells such as Detect Magic, Dispel Magic, Counterspell or Antimagic Field have no effect on the operation of a gadget.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Gadgets</name>			<text>Gadget Schematics:</text>			<text>	Gadgets are built using schematics which show the design parameters and intended operation of the device. Each schematic has a level of complexity that is classified as trivial, simple, advanced or intricate. </text>			<text>	You know 5 trivial schematics and 3 simple schematics of your choice from the list of gadget schematics presented in Part 2 of this supplement. The Schematics Known column of the engineer table shows when you learn additional schematics. </text>			<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in the engineer class, you can choose one of the schematics that you know and replace it with a different schematic from the schematic list. Any new schematic that you learn must be of a level of complexity which you are able to equip. </text>			<text>	Learning a schematic and turning the schematic into a working gadget costs an amount of money and time depending on the level of complexity. These costs include the parts and components needed to build the device as well the time spent prototyping, testing and troubleshooting the gadget to perfect its operation. The costs and time required for learning a new schematic are: </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Cost to Learn New Gadgets: </text>			<text>Complexity Level &#8212; Cost &#8212; Time: </text>			<text>Trivial &#8212; 10 gp &#8212; 1 hour </text>			<text>Simple &#8212; 50 gp &#8212; 2 hours </text>			<text>Advanced &#8212; 250 gp &#8212; 8 hours </text>			<text>Intricate &#8212; 1,250 gp &#8212; 40 hours</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>	You learn two additional schematics at 2nd, 6th, 11th, 12th, 14th, and 20th level, and one additional schematic at all other levels. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Equipped Gadgets: </text>			<text>	It takes time and effort to build and maintain your gadgets in working order. Repairs and preventive maintenance must be performed: sprockets greased, springs wound, coolant refilled, capacitors recharged, etc. For this reason, you can only maintain a limited number of equipped gadgets at any one time, as shown on the engineer table. As you level up, you become more skilled at building and maintaining these gadgets and are able to keep more of them functional at any one time. </text>			<text>	Each equipped gadget is integrated into one of your items of clothing or equipment as specified in the schematic description. Multiple gadgets using different schematics can each be integrated into the same piece of equipment. Each equipped gadget increases the weight of the item it is integrated into by 2 pounds. </text>			<text>	You prepare your list of equipped gadgets from the list of schematics that you know, up to the maximum number shown on the engineer table. In order to equip a gadget you must have an available gadget slot of the same or higher level of complexity as the schematic for the gadget. </text>			<text>	Because of the expertise required to operate these gadgets and amount of personal customizations that each engineer makes to their gadgets, only the engineer that built it can use a gadget and benefit from its effects. </text>			<text>	Whenever you complete a long rest you can reconfigure your list of active gadgets, changing which gadgets you have equipped from among the schematics that you know. You can also remove a gadget from a single piece of equipment and install it onto a different piece of equipment whenever you reconfigure your gadgets. You must have access to your tinker&#8217;s tools in order to reconfigure your equipped gadgets. </text>			<text>	You can equip four trivial gadgets at 1st level, 5 at 4th level, and 6 at 9th level or higher.  You can equip 2 simple gadgets at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 5th, 5 at 8th, and 6 at 13th or higher.  You can equip 1 advanced gadget at 7th level, 2 at 8th, 3 at 10th, 4 at 13th, and 5 at 16th or higher.  You can equip 1 intricate gadget at 15th level, 2 at 17th, and 3 at 19th or higher.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Mechanically Inclined</name>			<text>Your skill with mechanical devices allows you to use your tinker&#8217;s tools to attempt to open mechanical locks and disarm mechanical traps.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>
	<autolevel level="2">		<slots optional="YES"></slots>		<feature>			<name>Expertise</name>			<text>At 2nd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with tinker&#8217;s tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiencies.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Master Crafter</name>			<text>You are a master crafter, capable of producing excellent work under budget and on time. Starting at 2nd level, when you craft an item using artisan&#8217;s tools that you have proficiency with, you must only expend raw materials worth one-third of the item&#8217;s total market value. You make progress every day you spend crafting in increments equal to 5 plus your engineer level in gp until you reach the market value of the item.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>
	<autolevel level="3">		<slots optional="YES">2, 1</slots>		<feature>			<name>Junkyard Hero</name>			<text>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your downtime to scavenge spare parts, useful chemicals, and raw materials which you can use to build your gadgets or to craft items. In order to do so, you must be in a city, junkyard, or another location where such items might be found. Your DM may limit the availability of certain types of materials depending on the location where you are scavenging. For each hour that you spend scavenging, you can locate 5 gp plus your engineer level worth of such materials. </text>			<text>	You can use the resources you collect while scavenging to pay the material cost of learning new gadget schematics, creating or repairing a clockwork companion, or as raw materials for crafting with artisans tools with which you have proficiency.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Sub-Discipline</name>			<text>Choose a sub-discipline, which describes your technological area of expertise. Three sub-disciplines are described here: demolitions, kinetics, and technomancy, all of which are detailed later in this class description. Your sub-discipline choice grants you additional features when you choose it at 3rd level and then again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Sub-Discipline: Demolitions</name>			<text>You are a student of the art of making things go boom. Your knowledge stretches from the mechanical (timers and detonators) to the alchemical (volatile compounds and chemical chain reactions). This knowledge allows you to craft and use small but powerful explosive devices which you can lob at your enemies on the battlefield.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bonus Proficiencies (Demolitions)</name>			<text>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist&#8217;s supplies and medium armor if you do not already have such proficiency. You also treat improvised weapons as simple weapons for purpose of proficiency.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bomb Maker (Demolitions)</name>			<text>Starting at 3rd level, your superior skill with explosive compounds allows you to create alchemical bombs known as tickers. A ticker is a small mechanical orb filled with volatile chemicals. When you attack with a ticker, it explodes, dealing damage to any creature around the detonation point. </text>			<text>	Because the chemicals used to create tickers are unstable, you can carry only a limited number of them with you. You can carry a number of assembled ticker bombs with you equal to your Intelligence modifier plus half of your engineer level. During a long rest you can create a number of tickers up to the maximum number you are able to carry. You must have access to your tinker&#8217;s tools and alchemist&#8217;s tools in order to create tickers. You must also have one vial of alchemical catalysts for each ticker that you wish to create. </text>			<text>	Tickers are normally inert, but are activated by using an object interaction in combination with your attack action when you throw the ticker. Once activated, the ticker will explode on impact when it lands. </text>			<text>	Tickers are treated as improvised ranged weapons for purposes of proficiency. They have the thrown trait and a range of 20/60. You can add either your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the attack roll when attacking with a ticker. Each ticker weighs 1 pound. </text>			<text>	If a ticker attack misses, the ticker will land 1d4 x 5 feet away from its intended target, exploding where it lands. Roll 1d8 to determine the direction of the miss: 1 &#8212; North; 2 &#8212; North East; 3 &#8212; East; 4 &#8212; South East; 5 &#8212; South; 6 &#8212; South West; 7 &#8212; West; or 8 &#8212; North West. </text>			<text>	The amount of damage done by a ticker you create depends on your engineer level. At 3rd level, your tickers do 2d4 damage, which increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 2d8 at 8th level, 3d6 at 11th level, 3d8 at 14th level, 3d10 at 17th level, and 4d10 at 20th level.  Tickers deal their full damage dice to any creature within 5 feet of the device when it explodes if they fail on a saving throw or half as much damage if they succeed. Targets 5-10 feet away from the explosion take residual splash damage which is reduced by one damage die. The splash damage is further reduced by half if the affected creature succeeds on a saving throw. The type of saving throw rolled against ticker damage is determined by the damage type of the ticker. The DC of a saving throw against your ticker damage is equal to your gadget save DC. </text>			<text>	For example, a ticker rated for 3d4 damage deals 3d4 (8) damage to any target within 5 feet of its detonation. The explosion also deals 2d4 (5) splash damage to targets 6-10 feet away from the blast. Both the regular and splash damage are halved if the affected targets succeed on their saving throw. </text>			<text>	You choose the type of damage that the ticker will deal when you create it. At 3rd level you know how to create both gas (poison damage, Constitution save) and incendiary (fire damage, Dexterity save) tickers. At 7th level you also gain the ability to create frag (piercing damage, Dexterity save) and frost (cold damage, Constitution save) tickers. When you reach 10th level you learn how to create concussion (thunder damage, Constitution save) tickers. Finally, at 14th level you gain the ability to build corrosive (acid damage, Dexterity save) and thermal tickers (radiant damage, Constitution save).</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Countdown Timer (Demolitions)</name>			<text>At 3rd level and higher, you gain the ability to rig a ticker so that it explodes on a timer instead of on impact. As an action, you can activate the timer of a ticker in your possession, choosing a number of rounds between 1 and 10. Once programmed, the ticker will detonate at the end of your turn after the chosen number of rounds has elapsed. A ticker on a timer can be disarmed by a successful disarm traps check with a DC equal to your gadget save DC.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Sub-Discipline: Kinetics</name>			<text>Kinetic engineers study the science of motion and the release of energy and apply this knowledge using specialized weapons called firearms. These exotic ranged weapons use a small, controlled explosive charge to propel metal projectiles (known as slugs) toward their target at a very high rate of speed, unleashing a devastating amount of kinetic energy.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bonus Proficiencies (Kinetics)</name>			<text>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms weapons and medium armor.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Gunsmith (Kinetics)</name>			<text>Starting at 3rd level, you know how to build and maintain firearms and ammunition using your tinker&#8217;s tools.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bonus Gadgets (Kinetics)</name>			<text>When you reach 3rd level you automatically gain access to your choice of either the schematic for the Gunshot Suppressor or the Concealed Carry gadget if you don&#8217;t already know this schematic. Learning the schematic does not count against your normal number of schematics known. Once you gain access to this schematic, you always have it equipped and it does not count against your maximum number of equipped gadgets.</text>			<text>	Again at 7th level you gain access to another bonus schematic of your choice. You may choose between either the Ammunition Clip or Targeting Scope gadgets. Learning the schematic does not count against your normal number of schematics known. Once you gain access to this schematic, you always have it equipped and it does not count against your maximum number of equipped gadgets.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Sub-Discipline: Technomancy</name>			<text>A technomancer understands that magic is merely a form of science that has not yet been completely understood. Technomancers commit themselves to the study of both magic and technology and seek to integrate the two into a potent whole.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bonus Proficiencies (Technomancer)</name>			<text>Beginning at 3rd level, you gain profi ciency in the arcana skill if you do not already have such profi ciency</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Bonus Schematics Known (Technomancer</name>			<text>When you reach 3rd level you learn 2 extra Schematics Known in addition to the number shown on the engineer table. You may choose an additional two bonus Schematics Known when you reach 7th level (+4 Schematics Known), 10th level (+6 Schematics Known) and again at 14th level (+8 Schematics Known). These schematics must be of a level that you can equip.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Techno Magic (Technomancer)</name>			<text>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your technological expertise with the ability to cast wizard spells. See chapter 10 of the Player&#8217;s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. </text>			<text>	Technomancers focus their magical study on two different schools of magic: Divination and Transmutation. Divination spells allow the technomancer to find objects and information through arcane means in addition to using more conventional methods of study; while transmutation spells allow them to change the state and nature of materials. Technomancers learn a relatively small number of spells, which they commit to memory rather than writing them down in a spell book. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Cantrips: </text>			<text>	You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spell Slots: </text>			<text>	The technomancer spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all your expended technomancer spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. </text>			<text>	For example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Identify, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher: </text>			<text>	At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, one of which you must choose from either the divination and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list. The other can come from any school of magic. </text>			<text>	You learn an additional wizard spell at each even-numbered Engineer level. Each of these spells must be a divination or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level no higher than your slot level. For instance, when you reach 8th level as a technomancer, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </text>			<text>	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. </text>			<text>	Whenever you gain a level as an engineer, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level no higher than your slot level, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you&#8217;re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spellcasting Ability: </text>			<text>	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spell save DC = 8+your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>	In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Mana Battery (Technomancer)</name>			<text>At 3rd level you gain the ability to channel your magic directly into your devices, expending one of your spell slots to recover the use of an activated effect of a gadget that would normally require a short or long rest to recharge. The level of the spell slot expended determines the complexity of the gadget that you can recharge. A 1st level spell can recharge a trivial complexity gadget, a 2nd level slot can recharge a simple or lower complexity gadget, a 3rd level spell slot can recharge a gadget of advanced or lower complexity, and a 4th level or higher spell slot can recharge the activated effect on a gadget of any complexity level. </text>			<text>	If you have another class with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features, you can expend a spell slot from any of your classes to recharge a gadget, not just spell slots gained from your technomancer sub-discipline.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>

If you miss on an attack with a ticker, roll to determine the direction and distance of the miss as normal. You can choose to reroll one of these results. If you do so, you must use the result of the second roll.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Fighting Style: Archery (Kinetics)</name>			<text>Starting at 7th level you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</text>			<modifier category="bonuses">ranged attacks+2</modifier>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Clockwork Companion (Technomancer)</name>			<text>When you reach 7th level you gain the ability to build a mechanical clockwork companion. Creating the clockwork requires 4 hours of time and costs 150 gp in raw materials. You must choose one of the two features listed below, which determine the form and function of the clockwork. </text>			<text>	The clockwork has the statistics of the chosen form, though it has the creature type construct instead of its normal type. Additionally, if the beast your clockwork emulates has an Intelligence score of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6 instead, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. The clockwork doesn&#8217;t require air to breathe, food, drink, or sleep and is immune to the effects of both poison and disease. </text>			<text>	While your clockwork companion is within one mile of you, you can issue commands to it via a wireless communications link. Activating this link requires you to use an object interaction. If the clockwork drops to 0 hit points it ceases to function. However, it can be repaired. Repairing a broken clockwork companion takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp in raw material. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Clockwork Familiar: </text>			<text>	Your clockwork takes the form of a small animal that acts as your familiar. The clockwork can be in the form of any small beast such as a bat, cat, crab, frog, hawk, lizard, owl, rat, raven, snake, spider, or weasel. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The clockwork familiar can&#8217;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal. Additionally, when you take the attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own. </text>			<text>	When you activate the wireless link to communicate with your familiar, if you are within 100 feet of your familiar, you can chose to see through your familiar&#8217;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. While perceiving through your clockwork familiar&#8217;s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech. You can end this link early by taking a bonus action on your own turn. </text>			<text>	When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, your clockwork familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll. You can use an object interaction to temporarily power off your clockwork familiar. The clockwork folds up into a 6 inch cube which weighs 1 pound, allowing it to be easily carried with you. The clockwork familiar can be reactivated by using another object interaction. </text>			<text>	You can only have one clockwork familiar at a time, but you can dismantle your existing clockwork and rebuild it in a different form. Rebuilding a clockwork familiar takes 1 hour. </text>			<text>	</text>			<text>Clockwork Steed: </text>			<text>	Your clockwork takes the form of a riding horse, pony, camel, elk, mastiff or other 4-legged riding beast. Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out. As an intelligent mount, your clockwork can either act independently of you or be controlled by you during combat. However, your steed always obeys your commands, even when acting independently of you. While mounted on your clockwork steed, any gadget effect that you control which would normally only affect you also affects your steed as well. </text>			<text>	erent form.

If you chose the Clockwork Familiar option your clockwork can cast Fireball, Hypnotic Pattern, or Major Image. If you chose the Clockwork Steed option, your clockwork can cast Fear, Fly, or Haste. </text>			<text>	These spells are cast as 3rd-level spells. For purposes of range and sight, the spell is treated as if it had been cast by your clockwork. However, any saving throw DC is determined as though you had cast the spell yourself.

You must place the turret in an unoccupied 5 foot space within 10 feet of you. The turret has a speed of 0, AC 10, 10 hit points, and is immune to psychic damage. When you deploy the turret, you load it with up to 10 pieces of ammunition from your inventory. </text>		<text>	At the end of each of your turns, the turret automatically targets the nearest enemy creature and makes an attack action against that creature. Each shot the turret fires consumes one of the pieces of ammunition that the turret is loaded with. The range of the turret&#8217;s attack is the same as the weapon that the turret is integrated with. When the turret attacks it adds both your proficiency bonus and your Intelligence bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, the turret deals damage equal to the damage dice for the weapon that the turret is integrated into plus your Intelligence bonus. </text>		<text>	The turret fires the weapon each round as long as there is a valid target within range. The turret functions for ten minutes or until the weapon it is integrated with runs out of ammunition or it is reduced to zero hit points. You can also use an object interaction to power the turret down early. </text>		<text>	When you reach 11th level, the AC of the turret increases by 3 (AC 13) and its hit points increase by an additional 10 (20 hit points). The AC and hit points increase again when you reach 17th level (AC 16, 30 hit points). </text>		<text>	Once you have used this gadget, its effect must be reset and cannot be used again until you complete a short or long rest.</text>		<text />		<text>Cost: 250 gp, 8 hours</text>		<text>Source: The Engineer p. 12</text>	</item>

Chose a location you have seen before or a particular creature that you are familiar with which is on the same plane of existence as you. If the target is a creature, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds the effect fails and you cannot use this gadget to target the same creature again for 24 hours. If the saving throw is failed, the gadget creates an invisible scrying sensor that allows you to see and hear as though you were standing 10 feet away from your target. The sensor moves with your target. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist. While observing your target through the sensor, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. The effect lasts for 10 minutes or until you chose to end it by taking another object interaction.

This energy sphere exists both on your current plane of existence and also extends into the border region of the Ethereal Plane. If a creature inside of this sphere attempts to use any ability, cast any spell, or activate any magic item or other device which would cause it to enter the Ethereal plane, that spell or effect fails. A creature already in the Ethereal Plane that enters the energy sphere or ends its turn there must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be forced from the Ethereal into the overlapping plane of existence.

At the beginning on your next turn, the device triggers, creating a seismic disturbance that causes an intense tremor in a 50-foot radius circle around the point where you placed it. This tremor shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area, with the following effects:</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>&#8226; The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>&#8226; Each creature on the ground must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>&#8226; Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature&#8217;s concentration is broken.</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>&#8226; The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the affected area. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure&#8217;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn&#8217;t fall prone or become buried.</text>		<text>	</text>		<text>	The above effects repeat at the beginning of each of your next two turns, unless you take an object interaction to end the effect early.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. </text>		<text>	Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. </text>		<text>	Part Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. </text>		<text>	Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. </text>		<text>	Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex. </text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook p. 227</text>	</spell>

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected. </text>		<text>	You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature &#8212; what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creatures thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check if it succeeds, the spell ends. </text>		<text>	Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. </text>		<text>	You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language. </text>		<text>	Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</text>		<text />		<text>Source: Player's Handbook p. 231</text>	</spell>

This growth increases its size by one category &#8212; from Medium to Large, for example.
