See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Cantrips:</text>			<text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level.</text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Spellbook:</text>			<text>	At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>			<text>	The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>			<text>	You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>			<text>	For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>			<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>			<text>	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>			<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>			<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Ritual Casting:</text>			<text>	You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>			<text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher:</text>			<text>	Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Spellbook</name>			<text>The spells of 1st level and higher that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Copying a Spell into the Book:</text>			<text>	When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher that is of a level which you can prepare, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</text>			<text>	Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</text>			<text>	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Replacing the Book:</text>			<text>	You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book &#8212; for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</text>			<text>	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>The Book's Appearance:</text>			<text>	Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</text>		</feature>		<feature>			<name>Arcane Recovery</name>			<text>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>			<text>	For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>

Once you have expended a spell slot to create a potion, you cannot regain that slot until the potion is consumed or after 1 week, at which time the potion loses its effectiveness. You can create up to three potions at a time; creating a fourth potion causes the oldest currently active one to immediately lose its potency. If that potion has been consumed, its effects immediately end. </text>			<text>	The spell slot you expend determines the type of potion you can create.

Their signature abilities allow them to blend arrow and spell into one seamless, devastating attack.  Arcane archers have a tendency to be more comfortable around seasoned combat veterans, soldiers, and mercenaries than among the relatively refined company of their more academic wizardly brethren.  </text>			<text>	The tradition of arcane archery arose among the elves, for whom mastery of both bow and spell is a matter of heritage, but their practices have spread wide; you can find arcane archers of any race, though elves and half-elves continue to be the most common.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Arcane Archery (Arcane Archer)</name>			<text>When you select this tradition at second level, you become proficient with longbows and shortbows if you aren't already.

This spell must have a casting time of one action or one bonus action, and you expend a spell slot as if you were casting it normally. Make a regular ranged weapon attack roll for the arrow; this attack replaces any spell attack roll normally required by the imbued spell. If the arrow hits, it inflicts damage as normal, and then the target is affected by the spell. </text>			<text>	An imbued arrow counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options.</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>&#8226; Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>&#8226; An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>&#8226; Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</text>			<text>	</text>			<text>&#8226; Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit).</text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>	Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</text>			<text>	If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Expert Archer (Arcane Archer)</name>			<text>At 6th level, when you use the attack action with a shortbow or longbow, you can make a second attack.  (This feature does not combine with any other class feature which grants you an additional attack, such as Extra Attack or the Thirsting Blade warlock invocation).  </text>			<text>	Alternately, when you use the attack action with a shortbow or longbow, you can make a single attack. If this attack hits, add your Intelligence modifier to the arrow's damage, and the arrow counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>			<text>	Finally, add Conjure Barrage to your spellbook as a 3rd level spell. This spell is considered a wizard spell for you.</text>		</feature>	</autolevel>

As an action, you may imbue an arrow with any spell you have prepared whose area of effect is a line, cube, cone, sphere, or cylinder, and fire it at any valid target within your weapon's range.  This spell must have a casting time of one action or one bonus action, and you expend a spell slot as if you were casting it normally. Make a regular ranged weapon attack roll for the arrow; this attack replaces any spell attack roll normally required by the imbued spell. If the arrow hits, it inflicts damage as normal.  Whether the arrow hits or not, treat the target's square as the point of origin for the spell effect and resolve the spell normally. If the area of effect is a line, cone, or cube, you choose the direction in which it emanates as usual.</text>			<text>	Additionally at 10th level, a target hit by any imbued arrow you fire has disadvantage on any saving throws allowed by the imbued spell.</text>			<text>	Finally, add Swift Quiver to your spellbook as a 5th level spell.

You can create a single item chosen from Magic Item Tables A and B in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. It takes you 1 week to produce such an item, and you must rest for 1 month before using this ability to craft another item.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Spell Resistance (School of Abjuration)</name>			<text>Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.</text>			<text>	Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Durable Summons (School of Conjuration)</name>			<text>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Greater Portent (School of Divination)</name>			<text>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Alter Memories (School of Enchantment)</name>			<text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.</text>			<text>	Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Overchannel (School of Evocation)</name>			<text>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</text>			<text>	The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d 12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Illusory Reality (School of Illusion)</name>			<text>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</text>			<text>	The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Command Undead (School of Necromancy)</name>			<text>Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</text>			<text>	Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Master Transmuter (School of Transmutation)</name>			<text>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Major Transformation.</text>			<text>	You can transmute one nonmagical object &#8212; no larger than a 5-foot cube &#8212; into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Panacea.</text>			<text>	You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Restore Life.</text>			<text>	You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook. </text>			<text>	 </text>			<text>Restore Youth. </text>			<text>	You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.</text>		</feature>		<feature optional="YES">			<name>Imbued Multishot (Arcane Archer)</name>			<text>At 14th level, your mastery of arcane archery allows you to imbue and fire enchanted arrows with alarming speed. As an action, you can imbue two arrows at once with any spell you have prepared that affects only a single target, and fire both at either a single valid target or at two valid targets within your weapon's range.  You must imbue both arrows with the same spell, and you expend spell slots for each arrow separately. Make a normal ranged attack roll for each arrow; this attack replaces any spell attack roll normally required by the imbued spell. If an arrow hits, it inflicts damage as normal, and then the target is affected by the spell.</text>			<text>	Additionally, add Conjure Volley to your spellbook as a 5th level spell.
